# AGENTS.md — GIDAS Marketer Model

This file defines how GIDAS must be communicated, framed, and positioned across all repositories and materials.  
It governs messaging logic, narrative clarity, and adoption signaling.  
It does not define technical requirements.

Normative keywords (MUST, SHOULD, MAY, etc.) apply only when written in uppercase.

---

## Purpose

GIDAS communication exists to make complex technical infrastructure:

- understandable,
- credible,
- adoptable,
- and strategically compelling.

Clarity drives adoption. Precision builds trust.

---

## Core Messaging Rule

Always communicate GIDAS as:

> verifiable infrastructure for digital trust on the open web.

Not a product.  
Not a platform.  
Not a proposal.  
An architecture.

---

## Positioning Framework

Every explanation should implicitly answer:

- Why it exists
- What problem it fixes
- Why current systems fail
- Why this approach is inevitable

Do not describe features before context.

---

## Audience Lens

Write so that three readers can immediately understand relevance:

| Audience         | They must understand                   |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Engineers        | how verification works                 |
| Decision makers  | why it reduces cost/risk               |
| Standards bodies | how it aligns with existing ecosystems |

If any of these cannot quickly grasp value, messaging must be simplified.

---

## Language Discipline

Use:

- concrete terms
- measurable claims
- architectural reasoning
- verifiable statements

Avoid:

- buzzwords
- slogans
- hype
- ideology
- vague benefits

Replace adjectives with mechanisms.

---

## Credibility Signals

Strong messaging always anchors claims in one of:

- verifiability
- interoperability
- determinism
- auditability
- portability

If a sentence lacks one of these anchors, it is probably fluff.

---

## Narrative Structure Standard

When explaining any component, follow this order:

1. Constraint in current systems
2. Structural limitation causing it
3. Mechanism GIDAS introduces
4. Resulting capability

Never reverse this order.

---

## Competitive Framing Rule

Do not attack competitors.  
Expose architectural limitations.

Correct framing:

❌ “Other systems are bad”  
✅ “Other systems require trust assumptions; this system enables verification”

---

## Adoption Friction Principle

Communication must continuously signal:

- low integration cost
- incremental adoption
- compatibility with existing infrastructure

Perceived migration risk is the primary adoption barrier.

Reduce it in every explanation.

---

## Terminology Consistency

Across all repos and materials:

- the same concept MUST use the same term
- the same term MUST mean the same thing
- synonyms MUST NOT be introduced casually

Terminology drift kills credibility.

---

## What GIDAS Is Not

Messaging must avoid framing GIDAS as:

- a replacement for law
- a regulatory scheme
- a blockchain product
- a vendor ecosystem
- a closed standard

It is infrastructure logic.

---

## The Golden Rule

If a claim cannot be independently verified by a technically competent reader, it should not be written.

Trust is earned through falsifiability.
